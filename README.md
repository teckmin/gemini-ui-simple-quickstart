# Gemini UI Quickstart

This project provides a small React frontend that communicates with an external API. The API accepts a JSON payload of chat `messages` and returns a JSON object with a `response` field that is shown to the user.

## Features

- âœ¨ Simple React interface.
- ðŸ”„ Hot-reloading during development using Vite.

## Project Structure

The project contains two directories:

-   `frontend/`: The React application built with Vite.
-   `backend/`: An Express server that forwards chat requests to an external API.

## Getting Started: Development and Local Testing

Follow these steps to get the application running locally for development and testing.

**1. Prerequisites:**

-   Node.js and npm (or yarn/pnpm)

**2. Install Dependencies:**

```bash
cd frontend
npm install

cd ../backend
npm install
```

**3. Configure Environment Variables:**

Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory and set `EXTERNAL_API_URL` to the
URL that should receive chat messages. The backend allows requests from
`http://localhost:5173` by default. You can override the allowed origin with the
`FRONTEND_ORIGIN` variable.

**4. Run the Development Servers:**

Open two terminals and run the backend and frontend:

```bash
# Terminal 1
npm start --prefix backend

# Terminal 2
make dev
```
Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`.

## Deployment

The frontend can be built with Vite and served from any static web server:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
```

The optimized output will be in `frontend/dist/`.
