# Gemini Fullstack Quickstart

This project demonstrates a fullstack application using a React frontend and a streaming backend agent. The agent performs comprehensive research on a user's query by dynamically generating search terms, querying the web using Google Search, reflecting on the results to identify knowledge gaps, and iteratively refining its search until it can provide a well-supported answer with citations. It serves as an example of building research-augmented conversational AI using Google's Gemini models.

## Features

- üí¨ Fullstack application with a React frontend and Node.js backend.
- üß† Powered by a research agent for advanced conversational AI.
- üîç Dynamic search query generation using Google Gemini models.
- üåê Integrated web research via Google Search API.
- ü§î Reflective reasoning to identify knowledge gaps and refine searches.
- üìÑ Generates answers with citations from gathered sources.
- üîÑ Hot-reloading for both frontend and backend development during development.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into two main directories:

-   `frontend/`: Contains the React application built with Vite.
-   `backend-node/`: Contains the Node.js API that forwards requests to an external service.

## Getting Started: Development and Local Testing

Follow these steps to get the application running locally for development and testing.

**1. Prerequisites:**

-   Node.js and npm (or yarn/pnpm)
-   **Note:** The backend proxies requests to an external service running on `localhost:6000`.

**2. Install Dependencies:**

**Backend:**

```bash
cd backend-node
npm install
```

**Frontend:**

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

**3. Run Development Servers:**

**Backend & Frontend:**

```bash
make dev
```
This will run the backend and frontend development servers. Open your browser and navigate to the frontend development server URL (e.g., `http://localhost:5173/app`).

_Alternatively, you can run the backend and frontend development servers separately. For the backend, open a terminal in the `backend-node/` directory and run `npm run dev`. For the frontend, open a terminal in the `frontend/` directory and run `npm run dev`. The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:5173`._

## How the Backend Works

The Node.js backend exposes a small API that forwards requests to an external service running on `http://localhost:6000`. It mirrors the endpoints expected by the frontend so that it can drop in as a replacement for the original FastAPI implementation.

## Deployment

The backend serves the prebuilt frontend from the `/app` route. A simple Docker setup is provided.

**1. Build the Docker Image:**

   Run the following command from the **project root directory**:
   ```bash
   docker build -t gemini-fullstack-langgraph -f Dockerfile .
   ```
**2. Run the Production Server:**

   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8123/app/` to see the application. The API will be available at `http://localhost:8123`.

## Technologies Used

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) (with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)) - For the frontend user interface.
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styling.
- [Shadcn UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/) - For components.
- [Google Gemini](https://ai.google.dev/models/gemini) - LLM for query generation, reflection, and answer synthesis.
